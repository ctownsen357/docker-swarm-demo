# docker-swarm-demo

**Note:** This isn't complete yet.  

This assumes you have several machines or VMs with Docker 1.12.x or greater installed.  It is very important that each machines time is synchronized via NTP or manually. For a quick and dirty test you can sync them manually with the following command:

```{bash}
$ sudo date --set="$(ssh you@your-computer date)"
```

### Initialize at least one Manager node
```{bash}
$ sudo docker swarm init 
```
This command will return the command you need to use in order to join the cluster; the command to be executed on your worker nodes.

**Note:** It has been my experience that on some machines setting the `--listen-addr your.ip.address:2377` is necessary.
* 

### Initialize one or more workers
```{bash}
$ docker swarm join \
>     --token SOME----LONG-----TOKEN \
>     manager.ip.address:2377
```


### Create a network overlay from a manager node
This allows the services to reference one another by container/service name just like one would do in a Docker Compose file:

```{bash}
$ docker network create --driver overlay my-app-network
```

### Create a service to run on the cluster (within the network overlay):
```{bash}
$ docker service create --replicas 1 --network my-app-network \
>   --name demo-redis redis
```

### Create a service to call Redis
I'm going to create a service that I can attach to, to run a simple Python script to interact with Redis.

```{bash}
docker service create --replicas 1 --network my-app-network \
--name demo-alpine alpine /bin/sh -c "trap 'exit 0' INT TERM; while true; do echo Hello World; sleep 10; done"
```

#### To do:
- Show how to list machines services are running on
- Explain how to attach to shell of Alpine container
- apk add --update py-pip
- test call to Redis service
- Scale Redis
- Demo that new service was brought online*
- Clean up README
